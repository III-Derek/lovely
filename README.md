To create a procedure that produces a preset beautiful template that combines and summarizes the texts, voices, images, and 
videos from a person’s daily lives and produces an engaging and visually appealing format to share with our lovely people. 
I want to create a communication environment powered by intelligent machines that brings people together by helping people 
logging their event during the day in the form of texts, photos, animated pictures, videos, where people would be able to 
see each other’s daily events in the order they uploaded it. Moreover, the underlying application system will be able to 
identify and describe the objects, places, restaurants that the other users shared in their daily log. This will help bridge
the knowledge gap between the two people.
